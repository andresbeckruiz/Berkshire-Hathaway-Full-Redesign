            <h2> 2021 Berkshire Hathaway Bracket Contest </h2>
            <h3> March 15, 2021 </h3>
      
            <p> OMAHA, NE—Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is pleased to announce that it will once again fund a
                “bracket contest” for employees of Berkshire Hathaway and its greater than 50% owned
                subsidiaries. Berkshire held its initial bracket contest in connection with the 2016 NCAA Men’s
                Division I Basketball Tournament. Additional contests were held each year until 2020 when the
                NCAA cancelled the tournament due to the pandemic.  </p>
      
            <p> At a minimum, Berkshire will be awarding $100,000 to the employee who picks the winner of the
                most games correctly prior to picking a game incorrectly. If an employee picks all first round
                games correctly (all 32 games played on Friday March 19th and Saturday March 20th), the prize
                will be increased to $1 million. However, if an employee is able to pick all first and second round
                games correctly, (all 48 games played between Friday March 19th and Monday March 22nd), the
                prize will be increased to an annuity paying $1 million a year for the remaining life of the
                employee. Finally, if Berkshire’s favorite basketball team, Creighton, is one of the last four teams
                remaining in the tournament, the winner’s prize will be doubled. </p>
