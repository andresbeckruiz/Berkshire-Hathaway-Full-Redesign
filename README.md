# Berkshire-Hathaway-Full-Redesign

In this project, I extended my initial redesign of Berkshire Hathawayâ€™s website that I completed as a project for CS1300: User Interfaces and User Experience. In the original project, I analyzed issues with the current Berkshire Hathaway website and then prototyped and built a new responsive homepage. The interface was designed for use on phones (~375x667px), tablets (~768x1024px), and computers (~3840x2160px), as well as layouts with dimensions within that range. 

The most salient piece of feedback I received on my original project was that I should include more introductory information about the company on the homepage of the website. Therefore, I worked on brainstorming and constructing an improved homepage for my extended redesign. I decided that including links to the most important pieces of information would help introduce new users to the website, as well as directing users to subsidiary companies that they might be interested in. I also spent time reorganizing how information was stored in the navigation bar and built several other responsive pages. To extend this project further, work could be done to implement search functionality for the website and develop a backend to retrieve current company news and reports to display on the website.
