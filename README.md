# Berkshire-Hathaway-Full-Redesign

In this project, I extended my initial redesign of Berkshire Hathawayâ€™s website that I built for CS1300: User Interfaces and User Experience. In the original project, I analyzed issues with the current Berkshire Hathaway website and then prototyped and built a new responsive homepage. The interface was designed for use on phones (~375x667px), tablets (~768x1024px), and computers (~3840x2160px), as well as layouts with dimensions within that range.

The most salient piece of feedback I received on my original project was that I should include more introductory information about the company on the homepage. Therefore, I brainstormed and constructed an improved homepage for my extended redesign. I decided that including quick links to the most important information and subsidiary companies would give users a good overview of Berkshire Hathaway. I also spent time reorganizing how information was stored in the navigation bar and built several other responsive pages. Further work can be done to implement search functionality and develop a backend to retrieve current company news and reports to display on the website.
