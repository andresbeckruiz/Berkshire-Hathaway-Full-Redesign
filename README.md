# Berkshire-Hathaway-Full-Redesign

This repository contains the code for my capstone project, completed for CS1300: User Interfaces and User Experience. I extended my original Responsive Redesign (https://excitedpenguin777.github.io/Berkshire-Hathaway-Responsive-Redesign/#) by improving the originzation of website content, updating the homepage based on peer feedback, and building the frontend for several other pages on the website.
