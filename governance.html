                </h1>
                <h2 id="qualifications"> Director Qualifications </h2>
                <p class="page-text"> In choosing directors, the Company seeks individuals who
                    have very high
                    integrity, business savvy, shareholder orientation and a
                    genuine interest in the Company.
                    The Company is required to elect a majority of directors who
                    are independent. All references
                    to “independent directors” in these guidelines are to
                    directors who are independent according
                    to the criteria for independence established by Section 303A
                    of the New York Stock
                    Exchange Listed Company Manual. The Board does not have
                    limits on the number of terms
                    a director may serve. The Board does not have any retirement
                    or tenure policies that would
                    limit the ability of a director to be nominated for
                    reelection. The Governance, Compensation
                    and Nominating Committee is responsible for nominating
                    directors for election or reelection.</p>
                <h2 id="size"> Board Size and Committees </h2>

                <p class="page-text"> The Board presently has 15 members (four management
                    directors, three nonmanagement but not independent directors
                    and eight independent directors). Under the ByLaws of the
                    Company, the Board has the authority to change its size, and
                    the Board will
                    periodically review its size as appropriate. The Board has
                    three committees:
                    (i) Audit; (ii) Governance, Compensation and Nominating; and
                    (iii) Executive. The Audit
                    and Governance, Compensation and Nominating Committees each
                    consist solely of
                    independent directors. The Board may, from time to time,
                    establish and maintain additional
                    or different committees, as it deems necessary or
                    appropriate. </p>

                <h2 id="voting"> Voting for Directors </h2>

                <p class="page-text list-after"> Any nominee for director in an uncontested election (i.e.,
                    an election where
                    the number of nominees is not greater than the number of
                    directors to be elected) who
                    receives a greater number of votes “withheld” from his or
                    her election than votes “for” such
                    election shall, promptly following certification of the
                    shareholder vote, offer his or her
                    resignation to the Board for consideration in accordance
                    with the following
                    2
                    procedures. All of these procedures shall be completed
                    within 90 days following
                    certification of the shareholder vote.
                    The Qualified Independent Directors (as defined below) shall
                    evaluate the
                    best interest of the Company and its shareholders and shall
                    decide on behalf of the Board the
                    action to be taken with respect to such offered resignation,
                    which can include: (i) accepting
                    the resignation, (ii) maintaining the director but
                    addressing what the Qualified Independent
                    Directors believe to be the underlying cause of the withhold
                    votes, (iii) resolving that the
                    director will not be re-nominated in the future for
                    election, or (iv) rejecting the resignation.
                    In reaching their decision, the Qualified Independent
                    Directors shall consider
                    all factors they deem relevant, including: (i) any stated
                    reasons why shareholders withheld
                    votes from such director, (ii) any alternatives for curing
                    the underlying cause of the withheld
                    votes, (iii) the director’s tenure, (iv) the director’s
                    qualifications, (v) the director’s past and
                    expected future contributions to the Company, and (vi) the
                    overall composition of the Board,
                    including whether accepting the resignation would cause the
                    Company to fail to meet any
                    applicable SEC or NYSE requirements.
                    Following the Board’s determination, the Company shall
                    promptly disclose
                    publicly in a document furnished or filed with the SEC the
                    Board’s decision of whether or
                    not to accept the resignation offer. The disclosure shall
                    also include an explanation of how
                    the decision was reached, including, if applicable, the
                    reasons for rejecting the offered
                    resignation.
                    A director who is required to offer his or her resignation
                    in accordance with
                    this Section 3 shall not be present during the deliberations
                    or voting whether to accept his or
                    her resignation or, except as otherwise provided below, a
                    resignation offered by any other
                    director in accordance with this Section 3. Prior to voting,
                    the Qualified Independent
                    Directors will afford the affected director an opportunity
                    to provide any information or
                    statement that he or she deems relevant.
                    For purposes of this Section 3, the term “Qualified
                    Independent Directors”
                    means:
                    (a) All directors who (1) are independent directors (as

                    with the NYSE Corporate Governance Rules) and (2) are not
                    required to offer
                    their resignation in accordance with this Section 3.
                    (b) If there are fewer than three independent directors then
                    serving on the Board
                    who are not required to offer their resignations in
                    accordance with this
                    Section 3, then the Qualified Independent Directors shall
                    mean all of the
                    independent directors and each independent director who is
                    required to offer
                    his or her resignation in accordance with this Section 3
                    shall recuse himself
                    or herself from the deliberations and voting only with
                    respect to his or her
                    individual offer to resign.
                    The foregoing procedures will be summarized and disclosed
                    each year in
                    the proxy statement for the Company’s annual meeting of
                    shareholders. </p>

                <h2 id="responsibilities">Director Responsibilities</h2>

                <p class="page-text"> The basic responsibility of the directorsis to exercise
                    their business judgment
                    to act in what they reasonably believe to be in the best
                    interests of the Company and its
                    shareholders, and to conduct themselves in accordance with
                    their duties of care and loyalty.
                    Directors are expected to attend Board meetings and meetings
                    of the committees on which
                    they serve, and to spend the time needed to carry out their
                    responsibilities as directors,
                    including meeting as frequently as necessary to properly
                    discharge those responsibilities.

                    of independent directors at least
                    once a year. The lead independent director will be the

                <p class="page-text">
                    Only directors who are neither an employee of the Company or
                    a subsidiary
                    nor a spouse of an employee receive compensation for serving
                    on the Board. Director fees
                    are nominal and are limited to immediate compensation.
                    Changes in the form and amount of
                    director compensation are determined by the full Board,
                    taking into consideration the
                    Company’s policy that the fees should be of no consequence
                    to any director serving the
                    Company. The Board critically reviews any amounts that a
                    director might receive directly
                    or indirectly from the Company, as well as any charitable
                    contributions the Company may
                    make to organizations with which a director is affiliated,
                    in determining whether a director
                    is independent. The Company does not purchase directors and
                    officers liability insurance for
                    its directors or officers.
